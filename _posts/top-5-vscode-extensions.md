# Top 5 VSCode Extensions for Frontend Developers

VSCode is the most used code editor for Software Engineers, and it is not a surprise. It is a powerful tool that can be customized to fit your needs. In this post, I will share my top 5 VSCode extensions for Frontend Developers.

## 1. Better Comments

**_[Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)_** is a VSCode extension that allows you to give superpowers to your comments! It allows you to add special colors to your commends in order to make them much more visible and understandable.

As an example, by default, when adding "TODO" at the beginning of the comment it will be all highlighted in a yellow color, so you can easily spot it in your code.

_The image above is taken from the official extension page._

Through the settings, you can customize the colors and the keywords/symbols that will be highlighted.
Honestly speaking, I don't know how I could live without this extension. It is a must-have for me!

# 2. ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets

If you frequently work with React, Redux or React Native, then you can't miss **_[ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets)_**. This extension provides you with a lot of useful snippets that will help you to write your code faster and more efficiently. Some of the snippets I use the most are:

- *imr*:

- `rafc`:

```javascript
import React from "react";

export const ComponentName = () => {
  return <div>ComponentName</div>;
};
```

- `rafce`:

```javascript
import React from "react";

const ComponentName = () => {
  return <div>ComponentName</div>;
};

export default ComponentName;
```

- `cmmb`:

```javascript
/**

| Your comment here
|--------------------------------------------------
*/
```
